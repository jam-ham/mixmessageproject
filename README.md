# mixmessageproject

#Hi all 

##In this repository you can see  a page with simplistic HTML and CSS.  The aim for this project was to focus on the JavaScript, and then practice sharing the files on GitHub. 

##Task 
The plan was to create a page which displays a random message every time the user presses the button.  

###Action Plan 
1.	Create a 3 text files:  mixmessages.html, mixmessagesdesign.css, randomMessageMaker.js

2.	Open the mixmessages.html file. Write  ‘RAMDOM MESSAGE GENERATOR’  between header tags inside the body.  Include a button which will later call a function. Write can an empty p tag and then  assign an  ID called "displayMessage". 
3.	Write CSS rules in the mixmessagesdesign.css  file. Implement classes and IDs to alter the content.  
4.	In the randomMessageMaker.js file  create an array, and then saved it to a variable called   randomMessage. Add strings inside the array (this will be the random messages).  Secondly write a function called   newMessage(). The  newMessage() should pick should one of the strings randomly when called. 
5.	Make sure you add the newMessage() function inside the button, and assign it to onclick, within mixmessages.html  file.   
6.	Within the mixmessages.html add a link to the  mixmessagesdesign.css file  inside the head. Then add a link to the   randomMessageMaker.js file at the bottom of the body. 
7.	Open   the mixmessages.html in a browser to check it is working and functioning correctly. 
8.	Open the command line(git bash) to add the files to the staging area and then commit them.  Also  follow the correct steps to share these files on GitHub.
